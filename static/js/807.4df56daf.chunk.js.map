My passion for solving complex problems has led me to\n        several exciting roles. I&apos;ve worked as a Bioinformatics and Data Science Intern at\n        AbbVie, and I am now a Machine Learning Researcher at Brown University&apos;s Shu Lab,\n        using Large Language Models to enhance the clinical note writing process.\n        I&apos;m actively seeking internship opportunities for\n        Summer 2025 in data science, machine learning, and software engineering.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At Brown, I serve as a Project Lead for Full Stack at Brown, where I coordinate and lead the\n        development of web applications for campus organizations. I&apos;m also a Full Stack\n        Developer for 24cast.org, a live election prediction model. Through Hack@Brown, I play an\n        active role on the Sponsorship team, fostering relationships with companies to secure\n        sponsors, mentors, and speakers for our annual hackathon. In addition, I&apos;m a proud\n        member of Brown&apos;s Salsa Club.&#128131;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Beyond academics, I love staying active with basketball, running, and biking. I also enjoy\n        discovering new music—lately, I have been enjoying Zach Bryan, Sade, The Cranberries, and\n        Clairo—and I&apos;m always open to recommendations!\n      </p>\n    </article>\n  </Main>\n);\n\nexport default Index;\n"],"names":["Index","_jsx","Main","description","children","_jsxs","className","id","Link","to"],"sourceRoot":""}
